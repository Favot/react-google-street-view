# React Google Street View

This repository is a sandbox for experimenting with the Google Street View API, how to create a npm package, and how to use it in a React application.
Don't take it too seriously for the moment.

It is based on the [react-google-streetview](https://github.com/alexus37/react-google-streetview) package.
